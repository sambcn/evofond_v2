## evofond_v2

Evofond with an epic GUI

# How to launch it ?

- Use a virtual environment (miniconda will do the trick) to use **python 3.6**
- Install libraries thanks to *requirements.txt*
- Use the commande line *fbs run* to launch the GUI

# How to get the .exe

Use the command line *fbs freeze*. The .exe is built in /target/evofond/
If you get an error, use --debug option and launch the .exe through command line. Some messages will give details on the error. 

# How do I use Evofond ?

Please see documentation for this question :)
